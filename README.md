## PHP-Project: Web Design for Horoscope Information
Welcome to my PHP-powered web design project developed using XAMPP. This website serves the purpose of providing users with personalized horoscope information along with a corresponding background image to enhance their experience.

# Functionality:
The website collects user information, such as name and date of birth, and utilizes PHP scripts to show them customized horoscope details based on the provided data. Additionally, it dynamically selects a background image that corresponds to the user's zodiac sign, adding visual appeal to the presentation of their horoscope information.
