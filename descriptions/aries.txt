As the first sign in the zodiac, Aries' presence always marks the beginning of something energetic and turbulent. They are continuously seeking dynamic experiences, speed, and competition, always striving to be first in everything from work to social gatherings. With its ruling planet Mars and belonging to the element of Fire (like Leo and Sagittarius), Aries is one of the most active zodiac signs. It is in their nature to take action, sometimes before thinking things through.
