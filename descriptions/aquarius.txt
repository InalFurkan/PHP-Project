Aquarius is one of the most unique signs of the zodiac, and people born under this sign experience a sense of uniqueness. This makes them eccentric and energetic in their fight for freedom, or at times shy and quiet, afraid to express their true personality. In both cases, they are deep thinkers and highly intellectual people who love to fight for idealistic causes. They can see people without prejudice, making them truly special. Although they can easily adapt to the energy that surrounds them, Aquarius representatives have a deep need for alone time to restore their inner power.
