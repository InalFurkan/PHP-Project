Virgos are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their deep sense of humanity, which makes them one of the most caring signs of the zodiac. Their methodical approach to love and life ensures that nothing is left to chance. Although they can be tender, they may keep their heart closed to the outer world. This sign is often misunderstood not because they lack the ability to express themselves, but because they don't always trust their feelings and tend to prioritize reason over emotions. The symbolism behind their name reflects their nature as individuals who approach everything as if it were their first time experiencing it.
