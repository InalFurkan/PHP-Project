Notes: 

project codes are available at horoscopes.php file.

I tried to put all the description files and the images into seperate folders. Writing the paths as "images/leo.jpg" or "descriptions/leo.txt". But in that case I couldnt reach those files to use in my program. Instead I put them directly to the folder which my php file is located. It solved for some didnt for some others.

I worked hard on making the program to function as it described in the final project description that has been shared with me. I made some configurations on some parts and tried to create solutions for some others. I am aware that my project lacks some functionality. But I couldnt understand why some parts didnt performed as I desired. So I decided to left them on my code. I ask you to take my codes into considerations for grading of my project.
